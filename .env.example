# Backend API Configuration
# Leave VITE_API_URL empty to use mock data (frontend-only mode)
# Set VITE_API_URL to your backend URL when backend is ready

# For mock data (current setup - no backend needed):
VITE_API_URL=

# When backend is ready, uncomment and update this:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Or for production backend:
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# Force mock data even if API URL is set (for testing):
# VITE_USE_MOCK=true
